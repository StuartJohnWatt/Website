All the following information is to the best of my knowledge.

This website does not require you to identify yourself. Information is collected by Google Analytics for analysing web traffic, although I do not have any access to this information other than in aggregated reports. This information is obtained by cookies, which to the best of my knowledge may be disabled by your web browser. In the Hugo framework settings for Google Analytics privacy settings I have set for your IP address to be randomised and for tracking to be disabled.
